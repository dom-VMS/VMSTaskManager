## Project Description
Varland Plating is an electroplating facility located in Cincinnati, Ohio. This project is to support the Maintenance department as they begin to bring the current Maintenance System out of the legacy system into a modern, web-based platform. The *Project Manager* section is an application where projects and their related tasks may be created and assigned to users. The ability to update information, log time, and have re-occuring tasks will all be implemented in the final solution.

## Inadequacy of Current Solution
Varland Plating has chosen to build this task management system in-house because of certain functionality that is missing in other platforms. Primarily, the ability to integrate the Maintenance System with this Project Management system. With this, preventative maintenance tasks can easily be incorporated with the the catalog of equipment at Varland. Other exisisting systems are too expensive.

## Approach
- Develop platform using Ruby on Rails & MySQL.
- Interview the Maintenance department managers to gain insight into what they want.
- Test with the Maintenance department.
- Leave the Project manager portion to allow for other departments the ability to use.
